## persist-checked

- [x] read done status from todos
- [ ] add localStorage to persist on refresh
  - probably need todo ids now for storage
  - also a separate delete todo? OR make you delete the whole project - persists the satisfaction of a clean list
- [ ] SOLID refactor of todo creation

## create new projects

We'll also need a new project button that, when clicked:

- creates a project form (enter a name)
- creates the new project
- displays the new project
